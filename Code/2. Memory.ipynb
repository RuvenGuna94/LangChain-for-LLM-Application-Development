    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers 4 ways to manage conversational memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ConversationBufferMemory**\n",
    "- This memory allows for storing of messages and then extracts the messages in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ConversationBufferWindowMemory**\n",
    "- This memory keeps a list of the interactions of the conversation over time. It only uses the last `K` interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ConversationTokenBufferMemory**\n",
    "- This memory keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ConversationSummaryMemory**\n",
    "- This memory creates a summary of the conversation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Memory Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some additional memory types supported by LangChain but are not discussed in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector data memory**\n",
    "- Stores text (from conversations or elsewhere) in a vector database and retrieves the most relevant blocks of text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity memories**\n",
    "- Using an LLM, it remembers details about specific entities (or people). \n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can also leverage multiple memories at one time. For example, conversation memory + entity memory to recall individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversations can also be stored in a conventional database as key-value store or SQL. "
