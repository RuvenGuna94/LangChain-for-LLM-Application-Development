    "\n",
    "When building an LLM-based application, evaluating the model's performance using clear and measurable metrics is a critical and often challenging step. These metrics not only help assess how well the model performs but also allow us to quantify the impact of any changes made to the application—such as integrating a Vector database—by determining whether these changes improve or degrade the application's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores some frameworks to evaluate LLM based applications.\n",

    "* Example generation\n",
    "* Manual evaluation (and debuging)\n",

    "What the Code Does:\n",
    "- Document Embedding: The code takes documents from the `loader`, processes them into text, and converts them into vector embeddings using the specified `embeddings` model.\n",
    "- Index Creation: The embeddings are stored in a `DocArrayInMemorySearch` vector store, creating an index that can be queried for similarity-based search.\n",
    "- Search-Ready: The resulting `index` can now be used to perform tasks like question-answering, semantic search, or retrieving relevant documents based on input queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakdown:\n",
    "1. **`VectorstoreIndexCreator`**:  \n",
    "   - This is a utility in LangChain that simplifies the process of creating an index for vector-based search. It manages the pipeline for embedding documents, storing them in a vector store, and making them searchable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`embedding=embeddings`**:  \n",
    "   - This specifies the embedding model to be used.  \n",
    "   - The `embeddings` variable likely holds a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's embeddings, Sentence Transformers, etc.), which converts text into numerical vectors for similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`vectorstore_cls=DocArrayInMemorySearch`**:  \n",
    "   - `DocArrayInMemorySearch` is a vector store implementation. It stores document embeddings in memory, making it fast for small to medium datasets.  \n",
    "   - This is a lightweight, in-memory solution for vector storage and similarity search, part of DocArray's library.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`.from_loaders([loader])`**:  \n",
    "   - The `.from_loaders()` method is used to populate the index with documents.  \n",
    "   - `loader` is likely an instance of a document loader (e.g., `TextLoader`, `DirectoryLoader`, etc.), which reads documents from a file, directory, or other sources and prepares them for indexing.  \n",
    "   - The `loader` provides the text data that gets embedded and stored in the vector store."
